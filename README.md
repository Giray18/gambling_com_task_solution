# Python Task Solution
This repo contains elements used for python based task solution. Basically, tasks is consisting of data manipulation and aggregated view creation activities by using Python.

## Solution Design
On solution concept OOP knowledge demostrated by creating 2 seperate python class on 1 .py file that holds class methods (functions) to provide solution for task requirements. 1 Jupyter notebook to initiate class and their methods. Mentioned class is saved into a custom module and being called into notebook as module. Steps of tasks are defined on code chunks of notebook as markdown. For to demonstrate advanced knowledge on python concepts like wrapper function, list comprehension and assert functions also used on solution.

As addition to requirements document, For to check source data quality and getting to know dataset without opening up source file. An extra method is used which creates an output file regarding mentioned quality checks. Location of output file can be found on below part.
